Poker, a table game loved by many in casinos, has been reborn as a falling object game! It’s called “Quick Hand Poker”! Quickly touch five objects on the screen that combine the suit and rank of playing cards to form poker hands! Aim for a high score within the time limit! Even if it’s your first time playing, don’t worry. The rules and hands of the game can be easily checked within the game!
Your browser does not support the video tag. What kind of game is Quick Hand Poker? Easy operation!
The operation is basically as simple as touching the screen! Select five objects from the falling card objects that form a poker hand! The selected five objects disappear, and new objects fall. Thus, you keep touching the objects on the screen one after another! This is almost all the operation! Simple rules!
The simple rule is to aim for a high score within the time limit (initially 30 seconds). Quickly form as rare poker hands as possible! The total of the ranks (numbers) of the selected five objects is multiplied by the multiplier corresponding to the hand, which is added as the score....</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-07-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>2024-07-10</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 🕹️ Mobile Game - Quick Hand Poker" href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/portfolio/work0003_quick_hand_poker/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>🤖 Distributing Games from Xcode to App Store Connect</h2></header><div class=entry-main><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://www.peanuts-code.com/images/tutorials/gd0023/00.png alt="Implementation after adding the Game Center plugin"></figure><div class=entry-item-wrapper><div class=entry-item><div class=entry-content><p>In this article, I’ll explain how to upload an iOS game exported from Godot to App Store Connect using Xcode. It’ll probably be short, so feel free to take it easy. Also, I’m assuming you’re familiar with Xcode, which is a macOS-exclusive app, so I’ll proceed with that in mind. Macs can be pricey, but if you want to release apps like iOS or macOS on the App Store, it’s an essential tool. I got mine with a 2-year Orico loan. It was tough, though 😆
Environment at the time of writing this article Xcode Version: 15.3 (15E204a)
Computer Model: MacBook Air M1, 2020
OS: macOS 14.4.1
Working with Xcode First, let’s open the project for the iOS version of your game exported from Godot in Xcode. If you peek into the folder where you exported it via Finder, you’ll find a file with a .xcodeproj extension. Just double-click on that (if there’s a .xcworkspace file generated due to adding plugins like Google AdMob, open that instead, but I won’t dive into that here).

If you’re wondering what Game Center is all about, I briefly explained it in the beginning of the previous article, so you might want to check that out first.
Broadly, I’ll explain in two main sections:
Setting Up Game Center in App Store Connect Implementing Game Center in GDScript By the way, the basic usage of plugins is documented in Godot Docs / iOS plugins / iOS plugins , so it would be reasonable to start there.
Also, you can find the code for the Game Center plugin on GitHub at Godot iOS GameCenter plugin . If you want to delve into the details, you can check it out. Personally, I found it a bit challenging at first.

First off, what is Game Center? For those unfamiliar, it’s a feature available on iOS devices like iPhones and iPads. By signing in with an Apple ID, Game Center records achievements and allows players to compete on leaderboards in supported games. Developers can set achievements, define their completion criteria, and decide what to compete for on the leaderboards.
Using the Game Center plugin in Godot, you can easily integrate these features into your games, which is pretty awesome.
By the way, you can find the official documentation and source code at the Godot iOS plugins repository , so take a look there first. If there’s anything you don’t quite understand, you can always come back to this article.

Don’t worry, you can learn the rules and tips from the “How to Play” section in the game!
Your browser does not support the video tag. What Makes It Lovely? The pastel-colored UI and pixel art card designs make it lovely! The trailing effect when dragging cards is cool!
Plus, the music is incredibly cool, the sound effects when moving cards are satisfying, making it lovely! So, be sure to turn on the sound while playing!
Also, the ability to automatically move cards with taps (isn’t that normal?), the support for Apple’s Game Center (also normal?), well, if you find all these trivial things lovely, then you must be lovely too!

Identification of Reflection Points After completing the development of “Slashing Samurai” and reflecting on the process and outcomes, various points for improvement became apparent. To better utilize these reflections in future game development, I want to document them thoroughly.
Let’s start by summarizing specific points for improvement:
Overdoing Too many stages Excessive difficulty Overemphasis on world-building Too late Implementation of plugins took too long Testing on actual devices was too slow Promotion preparation was too slow I will provide detailed records for each of these.
Overdoing Let’s begin by discussing the common pitfalls of the “overdoing it” category, which many novice developers, including myself, tend to fall into.
Too Many Stages Rather than doing this with good intentions, I might have unconsciously avoided the struggles of subtraction....</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2024-01-11 00:00:00 +0900 +0900'>2024-01-11</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;11 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 📔 Devlog: Slashing Samurai - Reflection" href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/post0005_slashing_samurai_devlogs/slashing_samurai_devlog_4/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>📔 Devlog: Slashing Samurai - Logic</h2></header><div class=entry-main><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://www.peanuts-code.com/images/posts/post0005/3_logic/07.gif alt="Devlog: Slashing Samurai - Logic"></figure><div class=entry-item-wrapper><div class=entry-item><div class=entry-content><p>This article is a record of the “logic” behind the development of “Slashing Samurai,” a mobile game for iOS released on the App Store on December 15, 2023, using the Godot Engine.

Identifying Necessary Screens I am the type to prioritize visuals. In game development, including the creation of “Slashing Samurai” in Godot, I started by identifying the necessary screens. I also considered the flow of screen transitions. Although there were many changes in the end, the base stayed relatively close to the initial plan. Initially, the plan included the following screens: Start Screen Play Screen (including Pause Screen) Stage Selection Screen Settings Screen In the end, the following screens were added: Prologue Screen Menu Screen Credit Screen Score Screen Falling Object Record Screen This devlog will focus on documenting the screens that were originally planned to be the core of the game.

Consideration of Assets to Use In this development log, we record how we prepared assets for the development of the mobile game “Slashing Samurai.” In the context of game development, assets refer to the materials used.
First, we listed the necessary assets and proceeded with a rough policy to prepare them with as low a budget as possible, considering the time cost.
The result of listing the assets necessary for the game is as follows:
Character images Object (falling items) images Background images Fonts Background music (BGM) Sound effects (SFX) We will detail how we prepared each of these materials one by one.
Character Images Initially, I attempted to draw the player character, a samurai, by myself. I even tried drawing a bit. It was a 2D drawing.

Defining the Rough Specifications of the Game The development process began by roughly defining the specifications of the game to be developed.
It was pre-determined that the game would be distributed globally on a specific platform. If aiming for global distribution, it was clear that it would require a certain level of quality to gain approval. Achieving this alone meant the game’s volume had to be kept small. For a game with a small volume, a casual game seemed appropriate. The essential element for casual games is user-friendliness. The most effective platform for maximizing user-friendliness is likely a mobile game. With devices that everyone carries, offering a small screen that serves as an input device, there seems to be no other platform that matches the physical convenience.
I have always loved RPGs....</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2023-12-24 02:21:00 +0900 +0900'>2023-12-24</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 📔 Devlog: Slashing Samurai - Planning" href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/post0005_slashing_samurai_devlogs/slashing_samurai_devlog_1/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>🕹️ Slashing Samurai</h2></header><div class=entry-main><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://www.peanuts-code.com/images/portfolio/slashing_samurai/app_icon/icon.png alt="Slashing Samurai game app icon ©︎ 2023 peanuts code"></figure><div class=entry-item-wrapper><div class=entry-item><div class=entry-content><p>Casual Timing Game, Slashing Samurai, is Here!

Basically, only one sound resource can be set per “AudioStreamPlayer” node. In other words, you must add “AudioStreamPlayer” nodes in the scene tree for each sound resource. You may feel useless in a situation where there are multiple nodes in the scene tree with the same settings except for the sound resource (as shown in the screenshot below), and you may also feel a little uncomfortable with the lack of visibility in the scene dock. So, if you have multiple sound resources that are never played simultaneously (e.g., multiple sound effects for different types of character attacks, multiple sound effects for different types of buttons on the UI, etc.), add only the minimum necessary “AudioStreamPlayer” node for each use to your scene. If you code a program that switches sound resources according to the situation, there will be no waste and the scene dock will look cleaner. In this tutorial, we will prepare only one “AudioStreamPlayer” node and...</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2022-10-19 19:45:00 +0900 +0900'>2022-10-19</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 🤖 Switching Sound Resources by Script in Godot3" href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/tutorials/gd0020_switching_sound_resources/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>🤖 Animation State Machine in Godot3</h2></header><div class=entry-main><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://www.peanuts-code.com/images/tutorials/gd0019_state_machine/img31.gif alt="Animation State Machine in Godot3"></figure><div class=entry-item-wrapper><div class=entry-item><div class=entry-content><p>This article describes an implementation of an animated state machine for a 2D game. A state machine controls the transition of an object from one state to another. There are several restrictions on state transitions, such as when an object can only transition from one state to a limited number of states, or when an object can only transition to the next state after the current animation ends. For example, “idle” and “run” can transition immediately in both directions, but “idle” to “attack” can transition immediately, but “attack” to “run” cannot, and “attack” to “idle” can transition only after the “attack” animation ends. The “attack” to “idle” transition occurs only after the “attack” animation is over. If all of these controls were coded in script, the code would tend to be rather long and complex. On the other hand, Godot’s “AnimationTree” node can be used to reduce the amount of script code and improve readability. In this article, we will show you how to implement a state machine using the “AnimationTree” node.

This is a commonly used method where the object to attack (e.g., player character) has a collision shape (called “Hit Box”) that is only active during the attack, and the object to be attacked (e.g., enemy character, destructible barrels, crates, grass, etc.) has a collision shape (called “Hurt Box). The hit judgment of the attack can be implemented by enabling/disabling the Hit Box and Hurt Box, and changing their size and position in accordance with the animation of the attack. This is relatively easy to implement, so let’s get started. Environment Godot version: 3.5.1 Computer OS version: macOS 11.6.5 Basic Articles You may also find the following articles useful.

Path finding is a function that determines the shortest possible path from an object to its destination, for example, when moving an object to a certain destination. Up to Godot 3.4, the Navigation node was used to implement path finding. This was not particularly inconvenient, but the methodology for game development using it was limited and inapplicable in some areas. This time, I would like to introduce an implementation method using Navigation Server, which was added to Godot 3.5. This is a backport from Godot 4, which is currently under active development.

It is not an absolutely necessary element of a game, but if used well, it can make the player’s game experience more interactive and directly affect the user experience. For example, there are many situations where it could be used, such as when a player fires a gun, takes damage from enemies, or falls from a high place. By the way, this kind of element that is not necessary but makes the game more interesting by adding it is called “game juice” in English. I have one more vocabulary in English, and I am a little wiser now.

However, the tutorial would be too large if it included all game elements such as decks, gacha, and battles with enemy characters, so we will focus on the puzzle part of the tutorial this time.

However, in general, game development tends to be frustrating. Let us first consider the reasons for this. Reasons for frustration First, game development is hard work. It is sometimes referred to as a comprehensive art form. In other words, a game is a work of art that combines music, images, characters, scenarios, systems, level design, and everything else into one. There is no way it is easy. It is so difficult that it is easy to fall behind in the process. However, there is another problem that is even bigger, especially for adults who are making games as independent developers. That is the fact that you can’t make money by developing games. If there is no money to be made, they quit this hard work. Game development is hard work, but it pays off when the game sells. The word “no money” may be a bit of a generalization, because there are always...</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=entry-footer><span title='2022-07-04 08:45:00 +0900 +0900'>2022-07-04</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 📔 How to avoid frustration of game development" href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/post0003_how_to_avoid_frustration/></a></article><footer class=page-footer><nav class=pagination><a class=next href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/page/2/>Next&nbsp;2/2&nbsp;»</a></nav></footer></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/>Peanuts Code</a></span> ·
