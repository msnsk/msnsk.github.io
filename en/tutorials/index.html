It’s not overly complex.
Some of you might be wondering, what exactly is grid-based movement? Grid-based movement is when objects, such as characters, move one grid (one tile) at a time on a game screen that is divided into evenly spaced grid lines.
To give some examples, think of older games like the Fire Emblem series, Tactics Ogre, or various simulation games. Even RPGs like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest during their 2D eras employed grid-based movement when it came to character movement on maps. Puzzle games like Tetris often use grid-based movement for the blocks or pieces as well.
As you can see, grid-based movement is widely used across many genres of games, making it a highly versatile feature.

My environment at the time of writing Godot version: 4.3
Computer model: MacBook Air M1, 2020
OS: macOS 14.6.1
Setting the Screen Size I’ll be using 16x16 px tile images this time, so I’ll make the Viewport small enough to fit the tiles neatly. After creating a new project, I went to Project Settings > General tab > Window and set the following:
Size: Viewport Width: 256 Viewport Height: 160 Window Width Override: 1024 (4 times) Window Height Override: 640 (4 times) *Window Width Override and Window Height Override can be set after enabling Advanced Settings in the top right of the settings panel. Then I scrolled down a bit in the settings panel and set the stretch mode to viewport so that the game graphics scale to fit the window size. I left the aspect ratio as is.

It’ll probably be short, so feel free to take it easy. Also, I’m assuming you’re familiar with Xcode, which is a macOS-exclusive app, so I’ll proceed with that in mind. Macs can be pricey, but if you want to release apps like iOS or macOS on the App Store, it’s an essential tool. I got mine with a 2-year Orico loan. It was tough, though 😆

Working with Xcode First, let’s open the project for the iOS version of your game exported from Godot in Xcode. If you peek into the folder where you exported it via Finder, you’ll find a file with a .xcodeproj extension. Just double-click on that (if there’s a .xcworkspace file generated due to adding plugins like Google AdMob, open that instead, but I won’t dive into that here).

Broadly, I’ll explain in two main sections:
Setting Up Game Center in App Store Connect Implementing Game Center in GDScript By the way, the basic usage of plugins is documented in Godot Docs / iOS plugins / iOS plugins , so it would be reasonable to start there.
Also, you can find the code for the Game Center plugin on GitHub at Godot iOS GameCenter plugin . If you want to delve into the details, you can check it out. Personally, I found it a bit challenging at first.

First off, what is Game Center? For those unfamiliar, it’s a feature available on iOS devices like iPhones and iPads. By signing in with an Apple ID, Game Center records achievements and allows players to compete on leaderboards in supported games. Developers can set achievements, define their completion criteria, and decide what to compete for on the leaderboards.
Using the Game Center plugin in Godot, you can easily integrate these features into your games, which is pretty awesome.
By the way, you can find the official documentation and source code at the Godot iOS plugins repository , so take a look there first. If there’s anything you don’t quite understand, you can always come back to this article.

Basically, only one sound resource can be set per “AudioStreamPlayer” node. In other words, you must add “AudioStreamPlayer” nodes in the scene tree for each sound resource. You may feel useless in a situation where there are multiple nodes in the scene tree with the same settings except for the sound resource (as shown in the screenshot below), and you may also feel a little uncomfortable with the lack of visibility in the scene dock.
So, if you have multiple sound resources that are never played simultaneously (e.g., multiple sound effects for different types of character attacks, multiple sound effects for different types of buttons on the UI, etc.), add only the minimum necessary “AudioStreamPlayer” node for each use to your scene. If you code a program that switches sound resources according to the situation, there will be no waste and the scene dock will look cleaner.

A state machine controls the transition of an object from one state to another.
There are several restrictions on state transitions, such as when an object can only transition from one state to a limited number of states, or when an object can only transition to the next state after the current animation ends. For example, “idle” and “run” can transition immediately in both directions, but “idle” to “attack” can transition immediately, but “attack” to “run” cannot, and “attack” to “idle” can transition only after the “attack” animation ends. The “attack” to “idle” transition occurs only after the “attack” animation is over.
If all of these controls were coded in script, the code would tend to be rather long and complex. On the other hand, Godot’s “AnimationTree” node can be used to reduce the amount of script code and improve readability. In this article, we will show you how to implement a state machine using the “AnimationTree” node.

This is a commonly used method where the object to attack (e.g., player character) has a collision shape (called “Hit Box”) that is only active during the attack, and the object to be attacked (e.g., enemy character, destructible barrels, crates, grass, etc.) has a collision shape (called “Hurt Box). The hit judgment of the attack can be implemented by enabling/disabling the Hit Box and Hurt Box, and changing their size and position in accordance with the animation of the attack.
This is relatively easy to implement, so let’s get started.

Path finding is a function that determines the shortest possible path from an object to its destination, for example, when moving an object to a certain destination.
Up to Godot 3.4, the Navigation node was used to implement path finding. This was not particularly inconvenient, but the methodology for game development using it was limited and inapplicable in some areas. This time, I would like to introduce an implementation method using Navigation Server, which was added to Godot 3.5. This is a backport from Godot 4, which is currently under active development. This article is intended for users of Godot 3.5 or later. Users of Godot version 3.4 or earlier should take note.

By the way, this kind of element that is not necessary but makes the game more interesting by adding it is called “game juice” in English. I have one more vocabulary in English, and I am a little wiser now.

This is easy to understand if you imagine a puzzle game like “Puzzle & Dragons” (a.k.a. “Puzzle Dora”), which has gained popularity as a mobile game.
However, the tutorial would be too large if it included all game elements such as decks, gacha, and battles with enemy characters, so we will focus on the puzzle part of the tutorial this time.

Match 3 is a puzzle game in which players move multiple colorful pieces evenly arranged along a grid on the board to eliminate three or more pieces of the same color in a row. This genre is particularly popular among mobile game players because it is easy to operate and enjoyable.
Candy Crush, Toon Blast, and Royal Match are just a few examples of popular games. Puzzle & Dragons and LINE Tsum Tsum are also based on Match 3, although the controls are slightly different. In this tutorial, we will create a puzzle like Candy Crush, in which the pieces are moved only one square at a time to match colors.

To focus on the creation of the homing missile, the rest of the project has been pre-created in advance.
The project file for this tutorial is located at GitHub repository . After downloading the .zip file, import the “project.godot” file in the “Start” folder into the Godot Engine, and you can start the project with only the preliminary work completed. If you would like to see the completed project in a hurry, import the “project.godot” file from the “End” folder.
All the assets imported into the project were downloaded from KENNEY website. I used an asset pack called Tower Defense (top-down) . I just want to thank them for making such a great asset pack available to the public.

The bullet hell is a large number of bullets (or similar long-range attacks) like a curtain. A “bullet hell shooter” is a game in which the player shoots at and defeats enemy characters while dodging and weaving through the gaps between the bullets. Some games specialize in simply dodging the bullets. Many games are based on the motif of spaceships and fighter planes that fit the image (in this tutorial, a ground battle between a wizard and a monster though).
In this tutorial, we will focus only on creating a bullet hell. Also, while bullet hell come in various shapes and sizes, we will focus on rotating-type bullet hell.

Specifically, they are as follows.
Handgun Shotgun Machine gun Laser Gun Environment This tutorial was created in the following environment
・Godot version: 3.4.2
・Computer OS version: macOS 11.6.5
Since this tutorial will focus on gun creation, the following has been prepared in advance.
1. Game world A scene called “World.tscn” was prepared, and the appearance was simply created by adding a “TileMap” node. In addition to the “TileMap” node, a “Player” node and several “Obstacle” nodes were added. For these, we created individual scenes and added the instances.
2. Player Character Created as “Player.tscn” scene. The root node is the “KinematicBody2D” class, and the “Sprite” and the “CollisionShape2D” were added as child nodes. The texture of the “Sprite” node is a hitman with a gun. A node named “Muzzle” of the “Position2D” class was placed at the tip of the image of the gun held by the hitman. This will be used later to specify the position where the bullet instance is generated when the gun is fired.
The following actions have already been added to the input map. Used to move the player character, shoot, and switch guns.
- up: W key - used to move the player character forward
- down: S key - used to move the player character backward.
- fire: Left mouse button - fires the gun.
- switch: Right mouse button: Switches between gun types.
Note that, for the sake of brevity in the tutorial, the player character’s sprite remains the same, even if the gun type is changed. Let’s say it looks like a handgun, but it can be a machine gun, a laser gun, or anything else.

In this article, I am going to introduce some so powerful and useful search features with keyboard shortcuts. Once you know those, you can reduce the huge amount of time looking for something which may be the most uninteresting in the game development. In addition, you can use the search features in a much faster way instead of looking for a script file and clicking it in the file system dock, for example.
By the way, we can see all default shortcuts in the official online documents of Godot. Be careful about that it says Alt as Option on macOS.
GODOT DOCS Default editor shortcuts Anyway, why do not you try to use the searches because it is sure to improve work efficiency.
I will introduce ones in order of the widest range of searches first.

Creating new projects Loading project files downloaded from the Web Renaming a project Removing projects that were previously managed by the Project Manager. When using Godot for the first time, a dialog box will appear as shown in the following screen shot, prompting you to open the Asset Library. The asset library can be easily accessed at any time, so choose Cancel for now.
