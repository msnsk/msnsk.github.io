The Project Manager is a tool for managing projects handled by Godot, including the following operations.\nCreating new projects Loading project files downloaded from the Web Renaming a project Removing projects that were previously managed by the Project Manager. When using Godot for the first time, a dialog box will appear as shown in the following screen shot, prompting you to open the Asset Library. The asset library can be easily accessed at any time, so choose Cancel for now.\nCreating a new project Click “New Project” from the right sidebar of the Project Manager.\nClick “Browse” to choose the path where you want to save the new project files.\nClick on “Create Folder” in the upper right corner of the window that opens.\nEnter a name for the folder. As an example, it was named “SampleProject”.\nOnce the folder is created, the folder path is automatically selected. Continue to click “Select Current Folder” in the lower right corner.\nThe “Project Name” and “Project Path” are now set. Select “OpenGL ES 3.0” unless you are planning to create a game for a web browser. Finally, click “Create \u0026 Edit”.\nNow you can start a new project.\nImporting a project When you want to check out a game created with Godot by another developer on GitHub on your computer, you can import an open-source project file that you have downloaded from the Internet into Godot.\nAlso, even if you have deleted your project from the Project Manager, as long as the project file remains, you can display it again in the Project Manager by using the “Import” operation.\nAs an example, let’s import a project published by GDQuest, which is the author of many easy-to-understand Godot tutorials.\nHarvester by GDQuest Extract the downloaded .zip file.\nReturn to Godot’s Project Manager and click on “Import” in the sidebar.\nClick the “Browse” button.\nOnce you find a file with a .godot extension in the “project” folder, select it and click the “Open” button in the lower right corner.\nNow that the references have been specified, execute “Import \u0026 Edit” to import the project.\nWhen the editor appears, the import is complete.\nEditing a project To edit a project in development, just double-click on the project or click “Edit” in the sidebar with the project selected.\nYou will then be taken to the editor. Double-click is faster and easier.\nRunning a project If you want to run the project as a game instead of editing it, first make sure the project you want to play is selected and click “Run” in the sidebar.\nThe window will then open as a game and can be played.\nRenaming a project With the project you wish to rename selected, click “Rename” in the sidebar.\nWhen the dialog box appears, enter a new name and click “Rename” in the lower right corner to confirm.\nRemoving a project As projects accumulate in the Project Manager, visibility becomes less and less. To reduce the number of projects listed in the Project Manager, you can “remove” a project.\nSelect the project you want to remove and then click on “Remove” in the sidebar.\nWhen a confirmation dialog box appears, click “Remove” in the lower right corner if there are no problems. If you uncheck the box marked “Also delete project contents (no undo!)”, the original file will not be deleted, but only from the Project Manager’s list.\nRemove missing projects If the actual files of a project are deleted or moved to another folder, the project manager will not be able to find a reference to the project, so the list will show “Missing Project” instead of the project name.\nTo remove such unreferenced projects from the Project Manager, click on “Remove Missing” in the sidebar. However, if there are no unreferenced projects, this button is grayed out, so this is not an operation that can be performed at any time.\nWhen a confirmation dialog box appears, if everything is OK, click “Remove All” in the lower right corner.\nIt can be confirmed that it disappeared clearly.\nConclusion The above is a description of what can be done with Godot Engine’s Project Manager and how it is operated.\n","wordCount":"724","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.peanuts-code.com/images/tutorials/gd0002_project_manager/en/img00.png","datePublished":"2021-10-30T12:30:09+09:00","dateModified":"2022-06-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"gobo"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/tutorials/gd0002_project_manager/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Peanuts Code","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.peanuts-code.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/ accesskey=h title="Peanuts Code (Alt + H)"><img src=https://www.peanuts-code.com/images/logomark.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Peanuts Code</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/portfolio/ title="Published Games"><span>Published Games</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/tutorials/ title=Tutorials><span>Tutorials</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/tutorials/>🤖 Tutorials</a></div><h1 class=post-title>🤖 Project Manager of Godot3</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-10-30 12:30:09 +0900 +0900'>2021-10-30</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;724 words&nbsp;|&nbsp;Translations:<ul class=i18n_list><li><a href=https://www.peanuts-code.com/ja/tutorials/gd0002_project_manager/>Ja</a></li></ul></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://www.peanuts-code.com/images/tutorials/gd0002_project_manager/en/img00.png alt></figure><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#creating-a-new-project aria-label="Creating a new project">Creating a new project</a></li><li><a href=#importing-a-project aria-label="Importing a project">Importing a project</a></li><li><a href=#editing-a-project aria-label="Editing a project">Editing a project</a></li><li><a href=#running-a-project aria-label="Running a project">Running a project</a></li><li><a href=#renaming-a-project aria-label="Renaming a project">Renaming a project</a></li><li><a href=#removing-a-project aria-label="Removing a project">Removing a project</a></li><li><a href=#remove-missing-projects aria-label="Remove missing projects">Remove missing projects</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>In this article, we will introduce what you can do with the Project Manager.</p><p>When Godot is launched, the first thing that appears is the Project Manager.
