      <description>In this tutorial, we will create an advanced match-3 puzzle game, a type of puzzle game in which one piece is moved freely on the board for a certain period of time to erase three or more pieces of the same color in a row.
This is easy to understand if you imagine a puzzle game like &amp;ldquo;Puzzle &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;rdquo; (a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;Puzzle Dora&amp;rdquo;), which has gained popularity as a mobile game.
However, the tutorial would be too large if it included all game elements such as decks, gacha, and battles with enemy characters, so we will focus on the puzzle part of the tutorial this time.</description>
