Basically, only one sound resource can be set per “AudioStreamPlayer” node. In other words, you must add “AudioStreamPlayer” nodes in the scene tree for each sound resource. You may feel useless in a situation where there are multiple nodes in the scene tree with the same settings except for the sound resource (as shown in the screenshot below), and you may also feel a little uncomfortable with the lack of visibility in the scene dock. So, if you have multiple sound resources that are never played simultaneously (e.g., multiple sound effects for different types of character attacks, multiple sound effects for different types of buttons on the UI, etc.), add only the minimum necessary “AudioStreamPlayer” node for each use to your scene. If you code a program that switches sound resources according to the situation, there will be no waste and the scene dock will look cleaner.

A state machine controls the transition of an object from one state to another. There are several restrictions on state transitions, such as when an object can only transition from one state to a limited number of states, or when an object can only transition to the next state after the current animation ends. For example, “idle” and “run” can transition immediately in both directions, but “idle” to “attack” can transition immediately, but “attack” to “run” cannot, and “attack” to “idle” can transition only after the “attack” animation ends. The “attack” to “idle” transition occurs only after the “attack” animation is over. If all of these controls were coded in script, the code would tend to be rather long and complex. On the other hand, Godot’s “AnimationTree” node can be used to reduce the amount of script code and improve readability. In this article, we will show you how to implement a state machine using the “AnimationTree” node.

The hit judgment of the attack can be implemented by enabling/disabling the Hit Box and Hurt Box, and changing their size and position in accordance with the animation of the attack.

This was not particularly inconvenient, but the methodology for game development using it was limited and inapplicable in some areas. This time, I would like to introduce an implementation method using Navigation Server, which was added to Godot 3.5. This is a backport from Godot 4, which is currently under active development.

Grid-based movement refers to the movement of objects such as characters on the game screen one grid at a time.
Many puzzle games such as the popular smartphone game “Puzzle & Dragons” and the original falling game “Tetris,” as well as tactical simulation games such as the “Fire Emblem” series and “Tactics Ogre” probably employ this type of movement.
On the other hand, RPGs such as the “Final Fantasy” series and the “Dragon Quest” series also use this grid-based movement when looking closely at character movement in the era of 2D graphics, when these games appeared as software for the NES and Super Nintendo.
Thus, grid-based movement is used in games of various genres, and its versatility is quite high.
In this article, we will focus as much as possible on only the implementation of grid-based movement. In addition, a sample game that uses grid-based movement will be introduced at the end of the article, so please feel free to refer to it as well.

Some games specialize in simply dodging the bullets. Many games are based on the motif of spaceships and fighter planes that fit the image (in this tutorial, a ground battle between a wizard and a monster though).
In this tutorial, we will focus only on creating a bullet hell. Also, while bullet hell come in various shapes and sizes, we will focus on rotating-type bullet hell.
Environment This tutorial was created in the following environment
・Godot version: 3.4.2
・Computer OS version: macOS 11.6.5
The project file for this tutorial is located at GitHub repository . After downloading the .zip file, import the “project.godot” file in the “Start” folder into the Godot Engine, and you will be able to start with a project that has only been prepped....</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=entry-footer>2022-05-23&nbsp;·&nbsp;2022-05-23&nbsp;·&nbsp;15 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 🤖 Bullet Hell in Godot3" href=http://localhost:1313/en/tutorials/gd0007_bullethell/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>🤖 Four Types of Guns for Top-down Shooting in Godot3</h2></header><div class=entry-main><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=http://localhost:1313/images/tutorials/gd0006_GunsOfTopdownShooter/img37.gif alt="Four Types of Guns for Top-down Shooting in Godot"></figure><div class=entry-item-wrapper><div class=entry-item><div class=entry-content><p>In this tutorial, we are going to make four types of guns that commonly appear in 2D top-down shooters. Specifically, they are as follows. Handgun Shotgun Machine gun Laser Gun Environment This tutorial was created in the following environment ・Godot version: 3.4.2 ・Computer OS version: macOS 11.6.5 Since this tutorial will focus on gun creation, the following has been prepared in advance. 1. Game world A scene called “World.tscn” was prepared, and the appearance was simply created by adding a “TileMap” node. In addition to the “TileMap” node, a “Player” node and several “Obstacle” nodes were added. For these, we created individual scenes and added the instances. 2. Player Character Created as “Player.tscn” scene. The root node is the “KinematicBody2D” class, and the “Sprite” and the “CollisionShape2D” were added as child nodes. The texture of the “Sprite” node is a hitman with a gun. A node named “Muzzle” of the “Position2D” class was placed at the tip of the image of the gun held by the hitman....</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=entry-footer>2022-05-07&nbsp;·&nbsp;2022-05-07&nbsp;·&nbsp;10 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 🤖 Four Types of Guns for Top-down Shooting in Godot3" href=http://localhost:1313/en/tutorials/gd0006_guns_of_topdown_shooter/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2 class=entry-hint-parent>🤖 Powerful Search Features in Godot</h2></header><div class=entry-main><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=http://localhost:1313/images/tutorials/gd0009_various_searches/img1.gif alt="Powerful search features in Godot"></figure><div class=entry-item-wrapper><div class=entry-item><div class=entry-content><p>When we develop a game, especially a big one, sometimes it may often happen that we can never find the scene which we want to edit or we cannot remember where the script file is, which we are going to edit.
In this article, I am going to introduce some so powerful and useful search features with keyboard shortcuts. Once you know those, you can reduce the huge amount of time looking for something which may be the most uninteresting in the game development. In addition, you can use the search features in a much faster way instead of looking for a script file and clicking it in the file system dock, for example.
By the way, we can see all default shortcuts in the official online documents of Godot. Be careful about that it says Alt as Option on macOS.
GODOT DOCS Default editor shortcuts Anyway, why do not you try to use the searches because it is sure to improve work efficiency.
I will introduce ones in order of the widest range of searches first.

When Godot is launched, the first thing that appears is the Project Manager. The Project Manager is a tool for managing projects handled by Godot, including the following operations.
Creating new projects Loading project files downloaded from the Web Renaming a project Removing projects that were previously managed by the Project Manager. When using Godot for the first time, a dialog box will appear as shown in the following screen shot, prompting you to open the Asset Library. The asset library can be easily accessed at any time, so choose Cancel for now.
Creating a new project Click “New Project” from the right sidebar of the Project Manager.
Click “Browse” to choose the path where you want to save the new project files.
Click on “Create Folder” in the upper right corner of the window that opens.
Enter a name for the folder. As an example, it was named “SampleProject”.
Once the folder is created, the folder path is automatically selected. Continue to click “Select Current Folder” in the lower right corner....</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=entry-footer>2021-10-30&nbsp;·&nbsp;2022-06-08&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to 🤖 Project Manager of Godot3" href=http://localhost:1313/en/tutorials/gd0002_project_manager/></a></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2024 <a href=http://localhost:1313/en/>Peanuts Code</a></span> ·
