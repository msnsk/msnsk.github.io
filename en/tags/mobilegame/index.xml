      <description>Introducing a Mobile Game, Lovely Solitaire! When it comes to solitaire (Klondike), it&amp;rsquo;s the king of classic one-player card games, and now, introducing the mobile game &amp;ldquo;Lovely Solitaire&amp;rdquo; available on the App Store! With its chic user interface, you can exude a sense of style even while playing on the train! (Or so we hope?) New to the game? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you can learn the rules and tips from the &amp;ldquo;How to Play&amp;rdquo; section in the game!
Your browser does not support the video tag. What Makes It Lovely? The pastel-colored UI and pixel art card designs make it lovely! The trailing effect when dragging cards is cool!
Plus, the music is incredibly cool, the sound effects when moving cards are satisfying, making it lovely! So, be sure to turn on the sound while playing!
Also, the ability to automatically move cards with taps (isn&amp;rsquo;t that normal?), the support for Apple&amp;rsquo;s Game Center (also normal?), well, if you find all these trivial things lovely, then you must be lovely too!
Free Download! You can access the page of &amp;ldquo;Lovely Solitaire&amp;rdquo; on the App Store from the banner below!</description>

      <description>This is poker turned into a falling object game! Poker, a table game loved by many in casinos, has been reborn as a falling object game! It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Quick Hand Poker&amp;rdquo;! Quickly touch five objects on the screen that combine the suit and rank of playing cards to form poker hands! Aim for a high score within the time limit! Even if it&amp;rsquo;s your first time playing, don&amp;rsquo;t worry. The rules and hands of the game can be easily checked within the game!
Your browser does not support the video tag. What kind of game is Quick Hand Poker? Easy operation!
The operation is basically as simple as touching the screen! Select five objects from the falling card objects that form a poker hand! The selected five objects disappear, and new objects fall. Thus, you keep touching the objects on the screen one after another! This is almost all the operation! Simple rules!
The simple rule is to aim for a high score within the time limit (initially 30 seconds). Quickly form as rare poker hands as possible! The total of the ranks (numbers) of the selected five objects is multiplied by the multiplier corresponding to the hand, which is added as the score.</description>

      <description>This article is a record of the &amp;ldquo;Planning&amp;rdquo; phase of the (post-release) devlog of the iOS mobile game &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai,&amp;rdquo; released on the App Store on December 15, 2023.

Defining the Rough Specifications of the Game The development process began by roughly defining the specifications of the game to be developed.
It was pre-determined that the game would be distributed globally on a specific platform. If aiming for global distribution, it was clear that it would require a certain level of quality to gain approval. Achieving this alone meant the game&amp;rsquo;s volume had to be kept small. For a game with a small volume, a casual game seemed appropriate. The essential element for casual games is user-friendliness. The most effective platform for maximizing user-friendliness is likely a mobile game. With devices that everyone carries, offering a small screen that serves as an input device, there seems to be no other platform that matches the physical convenience.
I have always loved RPGs.</description>

Identification of Reflection Points After completing the development of &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai&amp;rdquo; and reflecting on the process and outcomes, various points for improvement became apparent. To better utilize these reflections in future game development, I want to document them thoroughly.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start by summarizing specific points for improvement:
Overdoing Too many stages Excessive difficulty Overemphasis on world-building Too late Implementation of plugins took too long Testing on actual devices was too slow Promotion preparation was too slow I will provide detailed records for each of these.
Overdoing Let&amp;rsquo;s begin by discussing the common pitfalls of the &amp;ldquo;overdoing it&amp;rdquo; category, which many novice developers, including myself, tend to fall into.
Too Many Stages Rather than doing this with good intentions, I might have unconsciously avoided the struggles of subtraction.</description>

Identifying Necessary Screens I am the type to prioritize visuals. In game development, including the creation of &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai&amp;rdquo; in Godot, I started by identifying the necessary screens. I also considered the flow of screen transitions. Although there were many changes in the end, the base stayed relatively close to the initial plan. Initially, the plan included the following screens: Start Screen Play Screen (including Pause Screen) Stage Selection Screen Settings Screen In the end, the following screens were added: Prologue Screen Menu Screen Credit Screen Score Screen Falling Object Record Screen This devlog will focus on documenting the screens that were originally planned to be the core of the game.

Consideration of Assets to Use In this development log, we record how we prepared assets for the development of the mobile game &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai.&amp;rdquo; In the context of game development, assets refer to the materials used.
First, we listed the necessary assets and proceeded with a rough policy to prepare them with as low a budget as possible, considering the time cost.
The result of listing the assets necessary for the game is as follows:
Character images Object (falling items) images Background images Fonts Background music (BGM) Sound effects (SFX) We will detail how we prepared each of these materials one by one.
Character Images Initially, I attempted to draw the player character, a samurai, by myself. I even tried drawing a bit. It was a 2D drawing. Using the Procreate app on the iPad, I could create animations simultaneously.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, we will create an advanced match-3 puzzle game, a type of puzzle game in which one piece is moved freely on the board for a certain period of time to erase three or more pieces of the same color in a row.
This is easy to understand if you imagine a puzzle game like &amp;ldquo;Puzzle &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;rdquo; (a.k.a. &amp;ldquo;Puzzle Dora&amp;rdquo;), which has gained popularity as a mobile game.
However, the tutorial would be too large if it included all game elements such as decks, gacha, and battles with enemy characters, so we will focus on the puzzle part of the tutorial this time.
For more information on how to create an standard match-3 puzzle game like &amp;ldquo;Candy Crush&amp;rdquo; or a puzzle game like &amp;ldquo;LINE Tsum Tsum&amp;rdquo;, please refer to the following tutorial.

      <description>In this tutorial, we will create a match 3 puzzle game. Match 3 is a puzzle game in which players move multiple colorful pieces evenly arranged along a grid on the board to eliminate three or more pieces of the same color in a row. This genre is particularly popular among mobile game players because it is easy to operate and enjoyable. Candy Crush, Toon Blast, and Royal Match are just a few examples of popular games. Puzzle &amp;amp; Dragons and LINE Tsum Tsum are also based on Match 3, although the controls are slightly different. In this tutorial, we will create a puzzle like Candy Crush, in which the pieces are moved only one square at a time to match colors.
