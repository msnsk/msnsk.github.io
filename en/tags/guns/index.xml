      <description>In this tutorial, we are going to make four types of guns that commonly appear in 2D top-down shooters. Specifically, they are as follows. Handgun Shotgun Machine gun Laser Gun Environment This tutorial was created in the following environment ãƒ»Godot version: 3.4.2 ãƒ»Computer OS version: macOS 11.6.5 Since this tutorial will focus on gun creation, the following has been prepared in advance. 1. Game world A scene called &amp;ldquo;World.tscn&amp;rdquo; was prepared, and the appearance was simply created by adding a &amp;ldquo;TileMap&amp;rdquo; node. In addition to the &amp;ldquo;TileMap&amp;rdquo; node, a &amp;ldquo;Player&amp;rdquo; node and several &amp;ldquo;Obstacle&amp;rdquo; nodes were added. For these, we created individual scenes and added the instances. 2. Player Character Created as &amp;ldquo;Player.tscn&amp;rdquo; scene. The root node is the &amp;ldquo;KinematicBody2D&amp;rdquo; class, and the &amp;ldquo;Sprite&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;CollisionShape2D&amp;rdquo; were added as child nodes. The texture of the &amp;ldquo;Sprite&amp;rdquo; node is a hitman with a gun. A node named &amp;ldquo;Muzzle&amp;rdquo; of the &amp;ldquo;Position2D&amp;rdquo; class was placed at the tip of the image of the gun held by the hitman.</description>
