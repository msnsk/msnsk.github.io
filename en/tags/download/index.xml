      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s Godot? Godot Engine, or simply Godot, is a very popular open-source game engine that is now gaining popularity, especially in the indie game industry.
A game engine is a reliable tool that handles all the complicated tasks for game developers by providing them with a system that is commonly needed in game development from the beginning so that they can concentrate on game development.
For example, &amp;ldquo;displaying characters on the screen,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;sound effects sound when buttons are pressed and the screen changes,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;shining light on 3D objects and drawing shadows,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;causing damage when a beam of light hits an enemy,&amp;rdquo; etc., are all common game development tasks that would be difficult if created from scratch. The game engine takes care of these processes for us.
In this article, I will explain the first step to start using Godot, which is to download it (very easy).
Godot is multi-platform. The files are available for almost all computers with major operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux) installed.
