      <title>üïπÔ∏è Lovely Solitaire</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-a-mobile-game-lovely-solitaire&#34;&gt;Introducing a Mobile Game, Lovely Solitaire!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to solitaire (Klondike), it&amp;rsquo;s the king of classic one-player card games, and now, introducing the mobile game &amp;ldquo;Lovely Solitaire&amp;rdquo; available on the App Store! With its chic user interface, you can exude a sense of style even while playing on the train! (Or so we hope?) New to the game? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you can learn the rules and tips from the &amp;ldquo;How to Play&amp;rdquo; section in the game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-makes-it-lovely&#34;&gt;What Makes It Lovely?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pastel-colored UI and pixel art card designs make it lovely! The trailing effect when dragging cards is cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, the music is incredibly cool, the sound effects when moving cards are satisfying, making it lovely! So, be sure to turn on the sound while playing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>üïπÔ∏è Mobile Game - Quick Hand Poker</title>
      <link>https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/portfolio/work0003_quick_hand_poker/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-is-poker-turned-into-a-falling-object-game&#34;&gt;This is poker turned into a falling object game!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poker, a table game loved by many in casinos, has been reborn as a falling object game! It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Quick Hand Poker&amp;rdquo;! Quickly touch five objects on the screen that combine the suit and rank of playing cards to form poker hands! Aim for a high score within the time limit! Even if it&amp;rsquo;s your first time playing, don&amp;rsquo;t worry. The rules and hands of the game can be easily checked within the game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;display: flex; justify-content: center;&#34;&gt;

    
    &lt;video controls autoplay loop muted playsinline aria-label=&#39;Quick Hand Poker Preview&#39; style=&#39;width: 40%&#39;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-kind-of-game-is-quick-hand-poker&#34;&gt;What kind of game is Quick Hand Poker?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy operation!&lt;br&gt;
The operation is basically as simple as touching the screen! Select five objects from the falling card objects that form a poker hand! The selected five objects disappear, and new objects fall. Thus, you keep touching the objects on the screen one after another! This is almost all the operation!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;align-center &#34;&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.peanuts-code.com/images/portfolio/quick_hand_poker/en/ss/ss_en_1.png#center&#34;
         alt=&#34;Quick Hand Poker Shot 1&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple rules!&lt;br&gt;
The simple rule is to aim for a high score within the time limit (initially 30 seconds). Quickly form as rare poker hands as possible! The total of the ranks (numbers) of the selected five objects is multiplied by the multiplier corresponding to the hand, which is added as the score. In other words, the rarer the hand, the higher the score. Moreover, the rarer the hand, the longer the bonus time added to the time limit, allowing you to play the game longer and aim for even higher scores!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>üìî Devlog: Slashing Samurai - Planning</title>
      <link>https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/post0005_slashing_samurai_devlog_1/</link>

      <guid>https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/post0005_slashing_samurai_devlog_1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is a record of the &amp;ldquo;Planning&amp;rdquo; phase of the (post-release) devlog of the iOS mobile game &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai,&amp;rdquo; released on the App Store on December 15, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slashing Samurai is available for free download on the App Store. Just click the banner below to get this game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/en/app/slashing-samurai/id6473121142&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.peanuts-code.com/images/banners/app_store/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_RGB_blk_092917.svg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34;/&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;defining-the-rough-specifications-of-the-game&#34;&gt;Defining the Rough Specifications of the Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development process began by roughly defining the specifications of the game to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pre-determined that the game would be distributed globally on a specific platform. If aiming for global distribution, it was clear that it would require a certain level of quality to gain approval. Achieving this alone meant the game&amp;rsquo;s volume had to be kept small. For a game with a small volume, a casual game seemed appropriate. The essential element for casual games is user-friendliness. The most effective platform for maximizing user-friendliness is likely a mobile game. With devices that everyone carries, offering a small screen that serves as an input device, there seems to be no other platform that matches the physical convenience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>üìî Devlog: Slashing Samurai - Reflection</title>
      <link>https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/post0005_slashing_samurai_devlog_4/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/post0005_slashing_samurai_devlog_4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is a record of reflections on the (post-release) development log of the iOS mobile game &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai,&amp;rdquo; released on the App Store on December 15, 2023. It explores areas for improvement and lessons learned during the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to download &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai&amp;rdquo; for free from the App Store using the banner below if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/slashing-samurai/id6473121142&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identification-of-reflection-points&#34;&gt;Identification of Reflection Points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing the development of &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai&amp;rdquo; and reflecting on the process and outcomes, various points for improvement became apparent. To better utilize these reflections in future game development, I want to document them thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start by summarizing specific points for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overdoing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too many stages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive difficulty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overemphasis on world-building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too late
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementation of plugins took too long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing on actual devices was too slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promotion preparation was too slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will provide detailed records for each of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

      <title>üìî Devlog: Slashing Samurai - Logic</title>
      <link>https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/post0005_slashing_samurai_devlog_3/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 04:00:00 +0900</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/post0005_slashing_samurai_devlog_3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is a record of the &amp;ldquo;logic&amp;rdquo; behind the development of &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai,&amp;rdquo; a mobile game for iOS released on the App Store on December 15, 2023, using the Godot Engine. However, to avoid excessive length, specific code details will be kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slashing Samurai is available for free download on the App Store. Just click the banner below to get this game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/en/app/slashing-samurai/id6473121142&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.peanuts-code.com/images/banners/app_store/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_RGB_blk_092917.svg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34;/&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identifying-necessary-screens&#34;&gt;Identifying Necessary Screens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the type to prioritize visuals. In game development, including the creation of &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai&amp;rdquo; in Godot, I started by identifying the necessary screens. I also considered the flow of screen transitions. Although there were many changes in the end, the base stayed relatively close to the initial plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://www.peanuts-code.com/images/posts/post0005/3_logic/01.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Note: Screen Transitions&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the plan included the following screens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play Screen (including Pause Screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage Selection Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settings Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the following screens were added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prologue Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menu Screen
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Score Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falling Object Record Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This devlog will focus on documenting the screens that were originally planned to be the core of the game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is a record of the &amp;ldquo;Assets&amp;rdquo; in the (post) devlog of the iOS mobile game &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai,&amp;rdquo; released on the App Store on December 15, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slashing Samurai is available for free download on the App Store. Just click the banner below to get this game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consideration-of-assets-to-use&#34;&gt;Consideration of Assets to Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this development log, we record how we prepared assets for the development of the mobile game &amp;ldquo;Slashing Samurai.&amp;rdquo; In the context of game development, assets refer to the materials used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we listed the necessary assets and proceeded with a rough policy to prepare them with as low a budget as possible, considering the time cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of listing the assets necessary for the game is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Character images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object (falling items) images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background music (BGM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sound effects (SFX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will detail how we prepared each of these materials one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently joined the &amp;ldquo;KENNEY Game Jam&amp;rdquo; held recently. It was my first game jam. In this article, I would like to write about the game jam for indie game developers held on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/jams&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;itch.io&lt;/a&gt;
 website, including what I learned and felt while participating in the game jam.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-game-jam&#34;&gt;What is a Game Jam?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A game jam is an event where participants develop a game in a short period of time, publish it, and evaluate each other. It is also called the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;hackathon&lt;/a&gt;
 of game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/jams&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;itch.io&lt;/a&gt;
 site sells games, assets, and hosts a number of game jams worldwide. Some are held monthly, some are held as an annual event, and there are a variety of small and large game jams, and there is always some sort of game jam going on throughout the year. &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2022&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;KENNEY Jam 2022&lt;/a&gt;
, which I attended, was also held at &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/jams&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;itch.io&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>üìî How to avoid frustration of game development</title>
      <link>https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/post0003_how_to_avoid_frustration/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 08:45:00 +0900</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.peanuts-code.com/en/posts/post0003_how_to_avoid_frustration/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When one has taken the trouble to start a personal game development project, one would like to continue it for a long and enjoyable time if possible. However, in general, game development tends to be frustrating. Let us first consider the reasons for this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4952908839423901&#34;
     crossorigin=&#34;anonymous&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins class=&#34;adsbygoogle&#34;
style=&#34;display:block; text-align:center;&#34;
data-ad-layout=&#34;in-article&#34;
data-ad-format=&#34;fluid&#34;
data-ad-client=&#34;ca-pub-4952908839423901&#34;
data-ad-slot=&#34;9419515863&#34;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasons-for-frustration&#34;&gt;Reasons for frustration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, game development is hard work. It is sometimes referred to as a comprehensive art form. In other words, a game is a work of art that combines music, images, characters, scenarios, systems, level design, and everything else into one. There is no way it is easy. It is so difficult that it is easy to fall behind in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is another problem that is even bigger, especially for adults who are making games as independent developers. That is the fact that you can&amp;rsquo;t make money by developing games. If there is no money to be made, they quit this hard work. Game development is hard work, but it pays off when the game sells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is especially worth reading if you are a beginner who has just started or is thinking about starting game development. We hope you will read it through to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, do you have a dream game that you really want to make? Many people who have started or are thinking of starting game development probably dream of such a game. And that game will have plenty of elements of games that you have played and been influenced by in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can probably guess, this article is now going to make the claim that you should save your dream game for the future. However, this assertion is not brand new, but rather a rather common piece of advice for novice game developers. Let me explain why you should save your dream game for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people want to start game development but tend to give up because of their age. No, this is not limited to game development but can be applied to anything from playing the piano to being a YouTuber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, it is a common perception that when you reach middle age, your physical and mental strength declines somehow. However, this is not true. There is no evidence that this socially accepted notion applies to you. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you are a middle-aged businessman, a first-grader, or a 90-year-old. The moment you decide you want to do something is the youngest time to start doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, life is about doing or not doing. At the age of 100 years of life, there are few cases where it is too late to start doing something. It would be a shame to make a decision based only on a vague impression that game development sounds too difficult for you. You will never know the truth until you try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a fact that game development is often thought of as a hurdle for the average person. When inexperienced people hear the word &amp;ldquo;game development,&amp;rdquo; they tend to imagine that they have to learn to program, that they don&amp;rsquo;t have a sense of design, that they can&amp;rsquo;t compose music, and so on. This impression of &amp;ldquo;difficult&amp;rdquo; gets stronger with age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
