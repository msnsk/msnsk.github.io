This is a commonly used method where the object to attack (e.g., player character) has a collision shape (called &amp;ldquo;Hit Box&amp;rdquo;) that is only active during the attack, and the object to be attacked (e.g., enemy character, destructible barrels, crates, grass, etc.) has a collision shape (called &amp;ldquo;Hurt Box). The hit judgment of the attack can be implemented by enabling/disabling the Hit Box and Hurt Box, and changing their size and position in accordance with the animation of the attack.
