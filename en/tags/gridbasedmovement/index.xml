      <description>This tutorial explains how to implement &amp;ldquo;grid-based movement&amp;rdquo; in 2D games. Grid-based movement refers to the movement of objects such as characters on the game screen one grid at a time.
Many puzzle games such as the popular smartphone game &amp;ldquo;Puzzle &amp;amp; Dragons&amp;rdquo; and the original falling game &amp;ldquo;Tetris,&amp;rdquo; as well as tactical simulation games such as the &amp;ldquo;Fire Emblem&amp;rdquo; series and &amp;ldquo;Tactics Ogre&amp;rdquo; probably employ this type of movement.
On the other hand, RPGs such as the &amp;ldquo;Final Fantasy&amp;rdquo; series and the &amp;ldquo;Dragon Quest&amp;rdquo; series also use this grid-based movement when looking closely at character movement in the era of 2D graphics, when these games appeared as software for the NES and Super Nintendo.</description>
