      <description>In this time, we will create a bullet hell aka barrage for a barrage shooting game. The bullet hell is a large number of bullets (or similar long-range attacks) like a curtain. A &amp;ldquo;bullet hell shooter&amp;rdquo; is a game in which the player shoots at and defeats enemy characters while dodging and weaving through the gaps between the bullets. Some games specialize in simply dodging the bullets. Many games are based on the motif of spaceships and fighter planes that fit the image (in this tutorial, a ground battle between a wizard and a monster though).
In this tutorial, we will focus only on creating a bullet hell. Also, while bullet hell come in various shapes and sizes, we will focus on rotating-type bullet hell.
Environment This tutorial was created in the following environment
ãƒ»Godot version: 3.4.2
ãƒ»Computer OS version: macOS 11.6.5
The project file for this tutorial is located at GitHub repository . After downloading the .zip file, import the &amp;ldquo;project.godot&amp;rdquo; file in the &amp;ldquo;Start&amp;rdquo; folder into the Godot Engine, and you will be able to start with a project that has only been prepped.</description>
